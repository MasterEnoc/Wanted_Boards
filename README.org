* Wanted Boards
Personal and local todo list-like boards, run it locally with flat
files.

* Overview
This is a todo list-like board web application, it is made with
express and pug. Runs locally, you only need to have a directory named
'wanted_boards' in your home directory with some directory and files
tree.

* wanted_boards directory structure
To properly works, Wanted Boards need the following structure:

[[./img/dirTree.png]]

Any user has to be a directory whose content is a directory named
"boards" and json file named as the user.

User json file contains the user name and its password.

Boards directory contains all the boards that will be displayed by
wanted boards in your browser. Each board file is a json file with a
specific structure (currently, wanted boards only display three
predefined tables, which are Todo, Doing and Done).

All of this directories and file can be created manually or running
its respectively bash script.

* Bash scripts
In the scripts are script that can help you creating the
"wanted_boards" directory.

Each file must be executable, you can do it running the following
command:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
    chmod a+x script_name
#+END_SRC

** defaultDir script
It creates a default wanted_boards directory structure with a
predefined user, password and boards.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
    ./defaultDir [-b]
#+END_SRC

You can use this command with the -b flag to make a bare directory structure.

** user script
Create a user directory and its json file.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
    ./user [new_user_name]
#+END_SRC

While executing will prompt you for a password, this password will be
used as the new user's password.

User script can show all users and delete users with flag -p and -d,
respectively.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# show all users
./user -p
# Delete a user
./user -d user
#+END_SRC

** board script
Creates a new board file with a predefined structure. it needs an
existing user to create a new board.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
    ./board [user] [new_board]
#+END_SRC

To delete and see all boards, use board script with flags as follow:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# show boards from a specific user
./board -p [user]
# delete a board from a specific user
./board -d [user] [board_name]
#+END_SRC

* How to use
First you need to have installed [[https://git-scm.com/][git]] and [[https://nodejs.org/en/][nodejs]].

clone this repository with the following command:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
    git clone https://github.com/MasterEnoc/Wanted_Boards.git
#+END_SRC

Install nodejs dependencies (you have to be in the wanted board directory):

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
    # go to the wanted boards directory
    cd wanted
    # install nodejs dependencies
    npm install
#+END_SRC

Now start wanted boards with:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
    npm start
#+END_SRC

Now open a web browser and go to http://localhost:8888/ you need to be
aware running wanted in this way you must have a instance of your
terminal running constantly the wanted service.

** Login screen
This is the first interaction you will have with Wanted Boards, try to
login with any user and password you have created or if you executed
the defaultDir script try:

username: root
password: password

Here is where you can add and delete task in each table, every board
can have different task.

You can hover over the name of the current board and a list of all
your boards will be displayed, you can click any board to change to it.

* How to run Wanted Boards as a service
This explanation is based in the current operative system I'm using,
Debian 10 (buster). Since Debian use systemd as init system you can
follow this instructions:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
    # create a file where all os services are stored
    touch /etc/systemd/system/node.service
#+END_SRC

node.service file should contain the following
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
[Unit]
Description=Personal todo board

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/home/user/wanted
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node /app/server.js
Restart=always
RestartSec=500ms
StandardOutput=syslog
StandardError=syslog
SyslogIdentifier=nodejs
User=enoc
Group=enoc
Environment=NODE_ENV=production

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
#+END_SRC

Then you can start the service with:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
    # start service
    service node start
    # stop service
    service node stop
    # restart service
    service node restart
#+END_SRC

If you want to start wanted service each time your operative system
boot run the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
    # we use 'node' due the file created in the systemd is named node.service
    systemctl enable node
#+END_SRC

Now you should be able to go to your browser and open Wanted Boards
without a new instance of your terminal constantly running with the
nodejs process.

You can find a more detailed version of how run any nodejs app as a
service in [[https://riptutorial.com/node-js/topic/9258/running-node-js-as-a-service][riptutorials]].
